## Project Overview

**Wanderly** is a fictional travel agency web application built as a design and development portfolio piece. The goal is to showcase UI/UX design, front-end architecture, responsive layouts, and interactions commonly used in travel booking interfaces (search, results, filters, booking flow, sponsor carousel, etc.).

This repository contains mock data, placeholder images, and example flows meant to demonstrate technical and visual skills — it is **not** an operational booking system and does not process real bookings or payments.

## Project Scope & Legal / Ethical Guidelines (Must Read)

* **This repository is explicitly a portfolio/demo project.** Do not present any part of this project as an official collaboration or sponsored product.
* **Sponsor logos and names are fictional or placeholders.** Never publish the project to a public site that could mislead visitors into thinking the sponsors are real without removing the placeholder content or adding a clear disclaimer on the page.
* **If you plan to deploy publicly:**

  * Keep a visible disclaimer in the site footer (for example: `Demo project — no real sponsors or booking functionality.`)
  * Make sure all images and assets are properly licensed.

**Failure to follow these guidelines may lead to legal or reputational issues if visitors interpret the site as representing real businesses.**
